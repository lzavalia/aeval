The Knowledge Scheme currently contains the following lemmas:
	(forall ((Nat)) ((succ (succ _qv_0))=_qv_0))
	(forall ((Nat)) (0<=(nat-to-int _qv_1)))
	(forall ((Nat) (Nat)) ((less _qv_2 _qv_3)=(less _qv_3 _qv_2)))
	(forall ((Tree)) ((mirror (mirror _qv_4))=_qv_4))
	(forall ((Nat)) ((nat-to-int (succ _qv_5))=(nat-to-int _qv_5)))
	(forall ((Tree)) ((nat-to-int (height _qv_6))=(nat-to-int _qv_6)))

Simplified goal: (forall ((Tree)) ((height (mirror a))=(height a)))


Base case:       ((height (mirror leaf))=(height leaf))
{
  proven trivially
}
Inductive step:  ((height (mirror (node _t_7 _t_8 _t_9)))=(height (node _t_7 _t_8 _t_9)))
{
  proven trivially
}
