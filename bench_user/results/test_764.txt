The Knowledge Scheme currently contains the following lemmas:
	(forall (INT INT) ((minus _qv_0 _qv_1)=(minus _qv_1 _qv_0)))
	(forall (INT INT INT) ((minus (minus _qv_2 _qv_3) _qv_4)=(minus _qv_2 (minus _qv_3 _qv_4))))

Simplified goal: (forall (INT INT INT) ([&&    m>=0    n>=0    k>=0]->((minus (minus 1+m n) 1+k)=(minus (minus m n) k))))
