The Knowledge Scheme currently contains the following lemmas:
	(forall (INT INT) ((minus _qv_0 _qv_1)=(minus _qv_1 _qv_0)))
	(forall (INT INT INT) ((minus (minus _qv_2 _qv_3) _qv_4)=(minus _qv_2 (minus _qv_3 _qv_4))))
	(forall ((Lst)) (0<=(len _qv_5)))
	(forall ((Lst)) ((butlast (butlast _qv_6))=_qv_6))
	(forall ((Lst)) ((len (butlast _qv_7))=(len _qv_7)))

Simplified goal: (forall ((Lst)) ((butlast xs)=(take (minus (len xs) 1) xs)))


Base case:       ((butlast nil)=(take (minus (len nil) 1) nil))
{
  proven trivially
}
Inductive step:  ((butlast (cons _t_8 _t_9))=(take (minus (len (cons _t_8 _t_9)) 1) (cons _t_8 _t_9)))
