The Knowledge Scheme currently contains the following lemmas:
	(forall ((Nat)) ((succ (succ _qv_0))=_qv_0))
	(forall ((Lst) (Lst)) ((append _qv_1 _qv_2)=(append _qv_2 _qv_1)))
	(forall ((Lst) (Lst) (Lst)) ((append (append _qv_3 _qv_4) _qv_5)=(append _qv_3 (append _qv_4 _qv_5))))

Simplified goal: (forall ((Lst)) (even (len (append x x))))


Base case:       (even (len (append nil nil)))
{
  proven trivially
}
Inductive step:  (even (len (append (cons _t_6 _t_7) (cons _t_6 _t_7))))
