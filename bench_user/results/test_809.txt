The Knowledge Scheme currently contains the following lemmas:
	(forall ((Lst) (Lst)) ((append _qv_0 _qv_1)=(append _qv_1 _qv_0)))
	(forall ((Lst) (Lst) (Lst)) ((append (append _qv_2 _qv_3) _qv_4)=(append _qv_2 (append _qv_3 _qv_4))))
	(forall ((Lst)) (0<=(len _qv_5)))

Simplified goal: (forall ((Lst)) (even (len (append x x))))


Base case:       (even (len (append nil nil)))
{
  proven trivially
}
Inductive step:  (even (len (append (cons _t_6 _t_7) (cons _t_6 _t_7))))
