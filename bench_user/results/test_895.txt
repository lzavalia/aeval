The Knowledge Scheme currently contains the following lemmas:
	(forall (INT INT) ((plus _qv_0 _qv_1)=(plus _qv_1 _qv_0)))
	(forall (INT INT INT) ((plus (plus _qv_2 _qv_3) _qv_4)=(plus _qv_2 (plus _qv_3 _qv_4))))
	(forall (INT INT) ((mult _qv_5 _qv_6)=(mult _qv_6 _qv_5)))
	(forall (INT INT INT) ((mult (mult _qv_7 _qv_8) _qv_9)=(mult _qv_7 (mult _qv_8 _qv_9))))
	(forall (INT INT INT) ((mult _qv_10 (plus _qv_11 _qv_12))=(plus (mult _qv_10 _qv_11) (mult _qv_10 _qv_12))))
	(forall (INT INT INT) ((plus _qv_13 (mult _qv_14 _qv_15))=(mult (plus _qv_13 _qv_14) (plus _qv_13 _qv_15))))

Simplified goal: (forall (INT INT) (((x>=0)&&(y>=0))->((mult x y)=(qmult x y 0))))
