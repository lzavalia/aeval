The Knowledge Scheme currently contains the following lemmas:
	(forall (INT INT) ((plus _qv_0 _qv_1)=(plus _qv_1 _qv_0)))
	(forall (INT INT INT) ((plus (plus _qv_2 _qv_3) _qv_4)=(plus _qv_2 (plus _qv_3 _qv_4))))
	(forall (INT) (0<=(double _qv_5)))
	(forall (INT) ((double (double _qv_6))=_qv_6))
	(forall (INT INT) ((double (plus _qv_7 _qv_8))=(plus (double _qv_7) (double _qv_8))))
	(forall (INT INT) ((double (plus _qv_7 _qv_8))=(plus (double _qv_8) (double _qv_7))))

Simplified goal: (forall (INT) ((x>=0)->((double x)=(plus x x))))
