The Knowledge Scheme currently contains the following lemmas:
	(forall (INT INT) ((plus _qv_0 _qv_1)=(plus _qv_1 _qv_0)))
	(forall (INT INT INT) ((plus (plus _qv_2 _qv_3) _qv_4)=(plus _qv_2 (plus _qv_3 _qv_4))))
	(forall (INT INT) ((minus _qv_5 _qv_6)=(minus _qv_6 _qv_5)))
	(forall (INT INT INT) ((minus (minus _qv_7 _qv_8) _qv_9)=(minus _qv_7 (minus _qv_8 _qv_9))))
	(forall (INT INT INT) ((minus _qv_10 (plus _qv_11 _qv_12))=(plus (minus _qv_10 _qv_11) (minus _qv_10 _qv_12))))
	(forall (INT INT INT) ((plus _qv_13 (minus _qv_14 _qv_15))=(minus (plus _qv_13 _qv_14) (plus _qv_13 _qv_15))))

Simplified goal: (forall (INT INT INT) ([&&    k>=0    m>=0    n>=0]->((minus (plus k m) (plus k n))=(minus m n))))
