The Knowledge Scheme currently contains the following lemmas:
	(forall (INT INT) ((plus _qv_0 _qv_1)=(plus _qv_1 _qv_0)))
	(forall (INT INT INT) ((plus (plus _qv_2 _qv_3) _qv_4)=(plus _qv_2 (plus _qv_3 _qv_4))))

Simplified goal: (forall (INT INT) (((x>=0)&&(y>=0))->((even (plus x y))=(even (plus y x)))))
