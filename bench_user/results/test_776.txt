The Knowledge Scheme currently contains the following lemmas:
	(forall ((Lst)) ((takeWhile (takeWhile _qv_0))=_qv_0))

Simplified goal: (forall ((Lst)) ((forall (INT) (P x))->((takeWhile xs)=xs)))


Base case:       ((takeWhile nil)=nil)
{
  proven trivially
}
Inductive step:  ((takeWhile (cons _t_1 _t_2))=(cons _t_1 _t_2))
{
  proven trivially
}
