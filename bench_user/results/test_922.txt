The Knowledge Scheme currently contains the following lemmas:
	(forall (INT INT) ((plus _qv_0 _qv_1)=(plus _qv_1 _qv_0)))
	(forall (INT INT INT) ((plus (plus _qv_2 _qv_3) _qv_4)=(plus _qv_2 (plus _qv_3 _qv_4))))
	(forall (INT INT) ((mult _qv_5 _qv_6)=(mult _qv_6 _qv_5)))
	(forall (INT INT INT) ((mult (mult _qv_7 _qv_8) _qv_9)=(mult _qv_7 (mult _qv_8 _qv_9))))
	(forall (INT INT) ((exp _qv_10 _qv_11)=(exp _qv_11 _qv_10)))
	(forall (INT INT INT) ((exp (exp _qv_12 _qv_13) _qv_14)=(exp _qv_12 (exp _qv_13 _qv_14))))
	(forall (INT INT INT) ((mult _qv_15 (plus _qv_16 _qv_17))=(plus (mult _qv_15 _qv_16) (mult _qv_15 _qv_17))))
	(forall (INT INT INT) ((exp _qv_18 (plus _qv_19 _qv_20))=(plus (exp _qv_18 _qv_19) (exp _qv_18 _qv_20))))
	(forall (INT INT INT) ((plus _qv_21 (mult _qv_22 _qv_23))=(mult (plus _qv_21 _qv_22) (plus _qv_21 _qv_23))))
	(forall (INT INT INT) ((exp _qv_24 (mult _qv_25 _qv_26))=(mult (exp _qv_24 _qv_25) (exp _qv_24 _qv_26))))
	(forall (INT INT INT) ((plus _qv_27 (exp _qv_28 _qv_29))=(exp (plus _qv_27 _qv_28) (plus _qv_27 _qv_29))))
	(forall (INT INT INT) ((mult _qv_30 (exp _qv_31 _qv_32))=(exp (mult _qv_30 _qv_31) (mult _qv_30 _qv_32))))

Simplified goal: (forall (INT INT) (((x>=0)&&(y>=0))->((exp x y)=(qexp x y 1))))
