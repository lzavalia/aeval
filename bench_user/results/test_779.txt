The Knowledge Scheme currently contains the following lemmas:
	(forall (INT INT) ((less _qv_0 _qv_1)=(less _qv_1 _qv_0)))
	(forall ((Tree)) ((mirror (mirror _qv_2))=_qv_2))
	(forall ((Tree)) (0<=(height _qv_3)))
	(forall ((Tree)) ((height (mirror _qv_4))=(height _qv_4)))

Simplified goal: (forall ((Tree)) ((height (mirror a))=(height a)))


Base case:       ((height (mirror leaf))=(height leaf))
{
  proven trivially
}
Inductive step:  ((height (mirror (node _t_5 _t_6 _t_7)))=(height (node _t_5 _t_6 _t_7)))
{
  proven trivially
}
