The Knowledge Scheme currently contains the following lemmas:
	(forall (INT INT) ((less _qv_0 _qv_1)=(less _qv_1 _qv_0)))
	(forall (INT INT) ((plus _qv_2 _qv_3)=(plus _qv_3 _qv_2)))
	(forall (INT INT INT) ((plus (plus _qv_4 _qv_5) _qv_6)=(plus _qv_4 (plus _qv_5 _qv_6))))

Simplified goal: (forall (INT INT) (((i>=0)&&(m>=0))->(less i 1+(plus m i))))
